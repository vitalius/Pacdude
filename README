IMPLEMENTATION DISCUSSION

Objects:

Pacman *. Contains all information about our lil hero, position,
	how many lifes he got, and so on.
Ghosts *. Contains all information about the ghosts, plus an
	array of pointers to specific ghosts, I assume? 
	maybe a structure to store the informations of each, e.g.:
typedef struct {
	int type;
	int colour;
	int how_many;
	struct *ghosts_t {
		int pos[1][1];
		int whatever;
	} ghosts[how_many];
} Ghosts;
(does that work, is that even valid C? lol)
Maze *. Our lil level!!!112.


Functions:

init*()
General: Init an Object, e.g. Pacman *p = initPacman().
	They may not return something.
	There should/could be a "master" init() that inits misc
	stuff like curses, sound (?) and other things.
	(initWindow() is depreciated therefore, is that ok?)
Location: Should they be in modules like (here) pacman/ or similar,
	accessible through pacman.h ; or should they be in init.h?


draw*()
General: Draw something on the screen. Frontends for curses 
	or alike, e.g. drawPacman(p).
Location: same question as above, in display/ modules or in
	display.h?


is*()
General: Query a status from the objects, e.g. if Pacman *p hit
	a wall: if ( isWall(m, getLocation(p,dir)) )
	

move*()
General: Move objects from the current location to other locations,
	or similar. 

get*()
General: get (system) information, e.g. the direction the user
	wants to move (he pressed cursor-left or sth). 
	Or what resolution we are on, in pixels or "characters".



Misc functions that don't belong into above groups:
	Should they be prefixed "misc"? Imho not.
	Self-explaining names should be sufficent.

      GAME-PLAY

  Suggestions:
     1. Ghost BOSS!!!111
     2. Let ghosts eat pebbles, and then when PacDude hits vitamin pill
        he'll pwn all the ghosts and their pebbles. If no more vitamin
        pills left, and ghosts still have some pebbles, then GAME OVAH!! 
     3. Super-Bonus-Pills allow PACDUDE eat through walls!
     4. Force fields, make pacdude drop a temporary wall in back of him
        to repulse ghosts that are chasing him, wall may last 3 seconds
     5. BIO-SLIME feature, if there is space ahead of pacdude, he may
        fire some bio-slime-web-like-rope that would attach to the end
        of the straight path, and will transfer our hero at 3x the speed.
