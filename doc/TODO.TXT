- Current Objectives

  1. Find a good data structure for maze, etc. 
     Build a char array that can be dumped with printf() to stdout of the maze
     Goal is to stick to the original as much as possible.

  2. Research the controller and input idea, wheather to use sigaction() 
     or SDL for catching the key presses, etc.

  3. Pwn some ncurses library demo, to get the feel of how ncruses work.
     Perhaps a simple timer and double-buffering technique. So that we could
     abstract the library specific function to something relative to the game.

  The controls are abit akward. We're just using ncurses and signal for now.
