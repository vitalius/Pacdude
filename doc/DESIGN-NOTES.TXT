Consider the MVC - Model View Control design approach.

outline info http://www.moock.org/lectures/mvc/

Since C isn't object oriented, MVC idea doesn't directly effect
our programs. However, the basic design idea presented behind
this design pattern, i think, is achievable even in C. 

At least, it would be considered as good aproach towards software design.
